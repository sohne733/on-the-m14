        <h1>ON</h1>
        <h2>THE</h2>
        <h3> M14</h3>
        <p> The evening lights of New York City were beginning to twinkle as the driver carefully guided the M72 to a slow stop at the corner of Central Park West. The bus exhaled with a hiss, and the doors swung open to let in the cool autumn air. A middle-aged man with an unsteady gait boarded, pulling a small, slightly worn rolling suitcase behind him. His eyes were tired, his clothes wrinkled, as if he’d had a long day. He nodded to the driver and took a seat near the front, his suitcase resting between his knees.
            As the bus resumed its journey, weaving through the bustling Upper West Side, the man suddenly sat bolt upright, panic flashing across his face. “I forgot a bag,” he exclaimed, his voice rising above the gentle hum of the engine and the quiet chatter of the other passengers.
            The driver, without hesitation, glanced at him through the rearview mirror. With a steady hand, he eased the bus to a stop along the curb, despite the busy traffic behind. The man, clearly anxious, shuffled off the bus, dragging his rolling suitcase, and disappeared into the dimly lit street to retrieve the forgotten bag.
            The passengers on board shifted in their seats, some glancing at their phones, others gazing out the window, but no one seemed to mind the unexpected delay. The city, after all, is a place where time moves differently—where small moments like these blend into the rhythm of daily life.</p>
            <p class="custom-text">After what felt like a long pause, the man reappeared, now juggling two bags. His face looked more relaxed, relieved even. He boarded the bus once more, offering a quiet "thank you" to the driver as he settled back into his seat, the two bags securely in his grasp.
                The bus resumed its route, picking up speed as it made its way towards the East Side. The glow of the city outside mixed with the soft interior lights of the bus, creating an atmosphere that felt almost serene, despite the chaos that is New York.
                When we reached the last stop, I gathered my things and made my way to the front of the bus. Pausing on the steps, I looked at the driver, who had navigated the evening traffic and delays with calm patience.
                “Thank you for being so patient with that passenger,” I said, offering him a grateful smile.
               He looked up, his face softening with a smile of his own. "I do what I can," he replied, his voice kind and unhurried, like someone who had seen it all but still found it in himself to care.
                As I stepped off the bus, the city continued to buzz around me, but I carried with me a quiet appreciation for the small acts of kindness that move unnoticed through the rush of urban life. In a city where everything feels fast and fleeting, moments like these remind you that people, even in the middle of the whirlwind, still take time to be human.</p>
